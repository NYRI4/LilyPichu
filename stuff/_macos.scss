/*
 * Vbriese here, I did this real quick but I noticed you wrap your other SCSS styles in a :root selector.
 * For some reason, the styles below just didn't work in a :root selector. (IDK I might be doing something dum.)
 *
 * On an unrelated note, it would help contributors if you let them know to compile using a command like this:
 * sass -w lilypichu.scss main.css --no-source-map
